# âœ¨ Unsharp Mask for Text Image Enhancement (OpenCV)

This project enhances the clarity of **text or document images** using the **Unsharp Masking** technique in OpenCV.  
Itâ€™s particularly useful for **improving scanned documents, blurred text, or faded prints**.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The **Unsharp Mask** technique sharpens images by:
1. Creating a **blurred version** of the original.
2. Subtracting the blurred image to isolate **edges and fine details**.
3. Adding these details back to the original with controlled intensity.

This makes the text edges crisper and improves readability while minimizing noise.
