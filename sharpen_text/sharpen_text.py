    Applies the Unsharp Mask sharpening technique.
    
    The Unsharp Mask works by subtracting a blurred version of the image
    from the original to isolate edges, then adding the scaled edges back.

    :param blur_sigma: Standard deviation for Gaussian blur. Controls the size of details to enhance.
                       A lower value (e.g., 1.0) is better for fine details like text.
    :param sharpen_amount: The intensity/strength of the sharpening effect (the 'boost').
    :return: The sharpened image as a NumPy array, or None if the image fails to load.
